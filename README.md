# Digit-Recognition
 A digit recognition model which identifies the spoken digits in an audio file  Fourier Analysis is used to get the energy spectrum of audio signals.  To Classify different digits signal K-Nearest Neighbours algorithm is used in Matlab.  This Model has Training Accuracy of 90% and Test Accuracy of 80%.
